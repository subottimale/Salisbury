First thing to know is that this is a patently ridiculous idea and, if you're seriously considering this, you're a ridiculous person. Congrats!
<br />
<br />Next thing to know is this is a Salisbury that's been modified for use in a Barca case (lopro minivan); therefore Coriander mounting. You may ask, "Why the wacky graphics?" and you would be right to do so
<br />
<br />The only layout offered is 3-1-3, so it uses the 'smol' firmware from Salisbury. Don't look for firmware here, there ain't any
<br />
<br />Point C is that I don't know if the Barca setup works at all, so I made my own silly dogbone-shaped case, featuring amateur sound mitigation contouring (boring flat bottom tray available, too...but why damnit why?!)
<br />
<br />**BEHOLD!!!**
